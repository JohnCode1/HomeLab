# üìÇ Purpose of Samba and What We Will Be Doing

* The purpose of Samba is to enable remote connections to your shared files.

* Later in the guide, we'll create a VM to run apps, and we can use Samba to connect that app VM to these files, keeping all your data in one central location.

* **Note:** Some apps require additional workarounds for this setup. For example, some users have reported issues running Jellyfin and torrent applications via Docker with this configuration, and had to create a separate folder on that VM to store the Docker files.

# üîß Installing and Setting Up Samba

1. Navigate to the VM or container you designated for media storage.

2. Run the following command to install Samba and then enter your password:

   ```
   sudo apt install samba -y
   ```

3. Edit the Samba configuration file:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
   ```

4. Insert the following variables and adjust them for each path you need. This example uses paths for media, and docker but repeat for each path you have.

   ```
   [global]
      server string = <hostname>
      workgroup = WORKGROUP
      security = user
      map to guest = Bad User
      name resolve order = bcast host
      hosts allow = <base ip>/<subnetmask> ex. 192.168.1.0/24
      hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
   [<name of path>]
      path = /<path>
      force user = <user name>
      force group = <user name>
      create mask = 0774
      force create mode = 0774
      directory mask = 0775
      force directory mode = 0775
      browseable = yes
      writable = yes
      read only = no
      guest ok = no
   [<name of path 2>]
      path = /<path 2>
      force user = <user name>
      force group = <user name>
      create mask = 0774
      force create mode = 0774
      directory mask = 0775
      force directory mode = 0775
      browseable = yes
      writable = yes
      read only = no
      guest ok = no
   ```

5. Press `Ctrl + O` to save, then `Enter` and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

6. Create a Samba password for your user:

   ```
   sudo smbpasswd -a <username>
   ```

7. Set the Samba services to automatically start on reboot:

   ```
   sudo systemctl enable smbd
   sudo systemctl enable nmbd
   sudo systemctl restart smbd
   sudo systemctl restart nmbd
   ```

8. If your main computer is running Windows, install the Windows discovery service:

   ```
   sudo apt install wsdd
   sudo apt install wsdd-server
   ```

9. If you have a firewall and are experiencing issues, allow the necessary services:

   ```
   sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
   sudo ufw allow Samba
   sudo ufw allow 3702/udp
   sudo ufw allow 5357/tcp
   sudo ufw allow 5358/tcp
   sudo ufw status
   sudo ufw enable
   ```

   * You should now be able to access these directories on your local network (LAN).

# üîó Connecting to the Samba Share

10. On the server you want to connect to your media server, install `cifs-utils`:

    ```
    sudo apt install cifs-utils -y
    ```

11. Edit the `/etc/fstab` file to automatically mount the Samba share on startup:

    ```
    sudo nano /etc/fstab
    ```

12. Add the following lines to the file, replacing the placeholders with your information. For this I created two shares one for media and one for docker

    ```
    //<ip of media server>/<path1> /<path1 cifs uid=1000,gid=1000,credentials=/home/<username>/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8 0 0
    //<ip of media server>/<path2> /<path2> cifs uid=1000,gid=1000,credentials=/home/<username>/.smbcredentials,iocharset=utf8 0 0
    #Working on creating a seperate share for next cloud when added to this guide
    //<ip of media server>/<path3 this one is specific for next cloud> /<path3> cifs rw,mfsymlinks,seal,credentials=/home/<username>/.smbcredentials,uid=33,gid=0,file_mode=0770,dir_mode=0770 0 0
    ```

13. Create a `.smbcredentials` file to store your Samba login information:

    ```
    sudo nano /home/<user>/.smbcredentials
    ```

14. Add these lines to the credentials file:

    ```
    user=<username on media server>
    password=<password on media server>
    ```

15. Press `Ctrl + O` to save, then `Enter` and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

16. Reload the system daemon, create paths, and mount the drives:

    ```
    sudo mkdir <path1>
    sudo mkdir <path2>
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo mount -a
    ```

17. Change the ownership of the mounted directories:

    ```
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /<path1>
    sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /<path2>
    ```

# üìÅ Creating File Paths

* Use the following commands to create the file paths that will be used for future applications in this guide:

```
mkdir -p downloads/qbittorrent/{completed,incomplete,torrents} && mkdir -p downloads/nzbget/{completed,intermediate,nzb,queue,tmp} && mkdir -p books/ && mkdir -p movies && mkdir -p music && mkdir -p shows && mkdir -p youtube
```
