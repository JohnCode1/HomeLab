# Structure of this guide and how to use
- - -
* This guide will have a link at the end of each page to the next page intended if completlely following in order.
* It is ok to follow out of order and pick and choose what you want but forewaring you might have to tweak somethings based off where you start.
    * example if you do not use the fileset up I have then you will have to tweak your set up.
* After the end of each page of next I will also include a link to get back to this page to navigate around easily.
* After the links I will post all additionally tweaks I have used in the past that I am currently not using and all terminal commands back to back without instructions to easily be able to find the command you need if already understanding what you are doing.
    * Example of this you follow the guide later make a mistake and have to restart your server from scratch, you can go there and easily copy and paste commands as needed without having to constantly scroll around.
