## üåü About This Project

This guide is designed to make setting up a homelab more accessible to those who are less involved in the technology world and to make the initial setup process easier and faster. I use this guide for my own personal homelab.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** This guide is intended for educational purposes. Any hardware damage or security breaches that may occur when using this guide are at your own risk.

## üéØ Who This Is For (And Who It Isn't)

* ‚ùå Homelabs are **not** for someone who wants to set it up once and never touch it again. While you could argue that if you never open it to the worldwide web, you would be safe even if a security flaw is found later, you would be doing so at your own risk.
* ‚úÖ This is for someone who wants to reduce or completely eliminate their subscription fees.
* ‚úÖ This is for someone who loves to tinker with things.
