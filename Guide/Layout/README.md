# 📚 Structure of this Guide and How to Use It

* ➡️ This guide provides links at the end of each page to lead you to the next page, allowing you to follow the sections in order.

* 🔄 It is also perfectly fine to follow this guide **out of order** and choose what you want to implement. However, be aware that you may need to make some tweaks depending on where you start.

  * > **Example:** If you do not use the file setup that I have, you will have to adjust your own setup accordingly.

* 🧭 At the end of each page, after the link to the next section, I will include a link to get back to this page for easy navigation.

* ⚙️ After the navigational links, I will list all the additional tweaks and terminal commands I have used in the past but are not currently in use. This allows you to easily find and copy the commands you need without having to constantly scroll.

  * > **Example:** If you follow the guide and later make a mistake, forcing you to restart your server from scratch, you can quickly find the commands you need in this section.
