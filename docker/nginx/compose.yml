\# This is a Docker Compose file. It defines and runs multi-container Docker applications.

\# 'services' defines the containers that make up your application.

services:

  # The 'proxy' service uses the Nginx Proxy Manager image to manage web proxies.

  proxy:

    # Specifies the Docker image to use. 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager' is a popular choice.

    image: 'jc21/nginx-proxy-manager:latest'

    # Assigns a readable name to the container.

    container\_name: nginx-proxy-manager

    # Instructs Docker to restart the container unless it is explicitly stopped.

    restart: unless-stopped

    # This mode allows the container to share the host's network stack, which is necessary for Nginx Proxy Manager to work correctly.

    network\_mode: host

    # 'volumes' are used for persistent storage. They map directories from your host machine to the container.

    volumes:

      # This volume stores all the core data for Nginx Proxy Manager.

      - data:/data

      # This volume stores the Let's Encrypt certificates for SSL/TLS.

      - letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt

    # 'healthcheck' defines a command to check if the container is healthy.

    healthcheck:

      test: \["CMD", "/usr/bin/check-health"]

      interval: 10s

      timeout: 3s



  # The 'ddns' service uses a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) updater for Cloudflare.



\# This is a simple 'helloworld' service used for testing the proxy setup.

  helloworld:

    # Specifies the image for the test service.

    image: 'karthequian/helloworld:latest'

    # Assigns a name to the container.

    container\_name: helloworld

    # Instructs Docker to restart the container unless explicitly stopped.

    restart: unless-stopped

    # 'ports' maps a port on your host machine to a port inside the container.

    ports:

      # Maps port 8888 on the host to port 80 in the container.

      - 8888:80/tcp



\# 'volumes' defines the storage volumes that are used by the services.

volumes:

  # The 'data' volume is for Nginx Proxy Manager's main data.

  data:

  # The 'letsencrypt' volume is for storing SSL certificates.

  letsencrypt:
